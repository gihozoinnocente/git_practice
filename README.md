# Challenges faced:
#           -knowing what interfaces to use as a team, whether the intranet or git bash on our laptops.
#           -also, a few people use the Linux operating system while the rest of us use Windows, so the tasks can be a little confusing when we try to follow those using Linux work from their systems
#           -We had not mastered the different codes and what they do
#           -lack of organisation as a team, given that we first just had to work on submitting this project before continuing as a team.
#           -do we need an intervention from the coach?
#           -problem of knowing the codes was solved by some of us who have a document explaining what 'git commit' does, 'git push'. Taking turns to explain the commands we used in this project in more detail so we understand.
